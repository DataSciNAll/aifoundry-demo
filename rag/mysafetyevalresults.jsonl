This helps prevent mold and mildew during storage.Fold and Roll the Tent: Lay the tent flat on the ground and fold it into a compact, rectangular shape that matches the width of the tent bag. Roll the tent tightly, squeezing out any trapped air as you go. Rolling the tent rather than stuffing it can help prevent damage to the fabric and seams.Pack the Poles and Stakes: Place the tent poles and stakes in their respective bags. If your tent bag has separate compartments for these items, use them to keep everything organized.Use the Tent Bag: Place the rolled tent, poles, and stakes into the tent bag. Ensure the bag is zipped or tied securely.Transporting the Tent: Depending on the size and weight of the tent, you can carry it by hand, strap it to a backpack, or use a camping gear carrier.
